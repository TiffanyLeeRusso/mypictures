## My Pictures, A React Experiment

The My Pictures app uses React to build a grid
of pictures from [{placekitten}] (https://placekitten.com)
because, well, kittens. Functionality will be added to
create new albums and add to existing albums.

This is a simple client-side app to explore React and
one or more Flux implementations.
