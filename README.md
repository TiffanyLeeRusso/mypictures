## My Pictures, A React Experiment

The My Pictures app uses React to build a grid
of cat pictures from [LoremFlickr] (https://loremflickr.com/).
The user can create new albums and add to existing albums.

Note LoremFlickr's picture "lock" does not actually guarantee
the same picture every time, depending on their caching situation.
In my experience it has been pretty reliable for a quick test of
this app, though.

This is a simple client-side app to explore React.
